### **Description**


A **Collaborative Drawing Canvas** app that allows users to draw, customize, and sync their work across multiple browser tabs, **without a backend** or **WebSocket**, ensuring state persistence through **LocalStorage**. This project is a fun challenge for **React** enthusiasts, designed to simulate multi-user collaboration in a unique offline-first approach.

This project is built with **React** and provides multiple drawing tools, undo/redo functionality, color selection, and more advanced features like canvas size adjustments and profile-based collaboration.
